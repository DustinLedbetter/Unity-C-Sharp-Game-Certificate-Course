# Unity-Game-Certificate-Course

This will change as I complete more of the course. I will add files that are useful to show the work I have done, but as these projects are quite large in scale I will not be uploading the entire project. 

Currently included:
1. Practice files for intro to course.
2. Intro [Guess the Number] game project.
3. currently working on a jack the giant remake (scripts for game will be uploaded when game is completed).
